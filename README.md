# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to my DSA journey! This repository documents my solutions to various LeetCode problems as I prepare for technical interviews. I solve these problems daily, focusing on understanding core concepts and patterns.

Each solution includes my:
- Thought process and approach
- Step-by-step explanation
- Time and Space complexity analysis
- Commented code implementation

I'm building this repo to:
- Track my DSA learning progress
- Create a helpful resource for others studying DSA
- Document problem-solving patterns for future reference
